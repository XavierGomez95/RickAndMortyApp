# Rick and Morty Android App

## ðŸ“± Overview

This Android application displays a list of characters from the **Rick and Morty** universe, fetched from the public [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/).  
The project is developed in **Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose**, **Room**, **Hilt**, and the **MVVM** pattern, following a **Layered Architecture** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸ”¹ Character List
- Displays a list of characters retrieved from the API.  
- Each item shows the **image**, **name**, and **status** (alive, dead, unknown) of the character.  

### ðŸ”¹ Character Detail
- When a character is selected, a detail screen shows additional information.  
- Data is displayed reactively through `StateFlow` defined in `ViewModel`.

### ðŸ”¹ Local Storage
- Uses **Room Database** to cache the characters fetched from the API.  
- The app first loads data from Room and fetches from the API if local data is unavailable.  
- Allows access to information even when offline.

### ðŸ”¹ Dependency Injection
- **Hilt** is used to manage dependency injection efficiently.  
- Enables easy injection into `ViewModels`, `Repositories`, and `UseCases`, reducing coupling between components.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

The project follows a basic **Layered Architecture** combined with the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern.

## ðŸ§ª Validation and Testing

To ensure quality and robustness, the following validation steps were performed:

- **API Testing:** Verified correct data retrieval and error handling.  
- **Local Cache:** Confirmed proper saving and loading of cached data from Room.  
- **State Management:** Tested UI behavior for loading, success, and error states.  
- **Manual Testing:** Full navigation tests, orientation changes, and data reload scenarios.
