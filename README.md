# Android Developer Assignment: Rick and Morty API App

## Overview

This assignment requires you to develop an Android application that fetches and displays data from the Rick and Morty
API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/). The application will focus on showcasing characters from the series.

## Problem Description

The primary task is to create an Android application that retrieves character data from the following API endpoint:

https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character

The application should display a list of characters and allow the user to view detailed information
about each character.

## Requirements

1.  **Character List Screen:**
    * Create an activity that displays a list of characters.
    * Each character item in the list should show some character information (e.g., picture, name, status).

2.  **Character Detail Screen:**
    * When a user clicks on a character item in the list, a new activity should open, displaying the remaining detailed
      information about the selected character.

3.  **API Usage:**
    * Use the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/) to fetch the character data.
    * The primary endpoint to retrieve character data is: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character

## Technical Guidelines

* You are free to use any libraries or frameworks you deem necessary.
* You are free to choose any appropriate architecture pattern for your application.
* The application should be implemented using Kotlin.

## Originality

Please note that the solution you submit must be your own work. Do not copy solutions from the internet or other sources. Your submission will be reviewed, and we will be looking for your personal approach to solving the problem.

## Creative Freedom

You are encouraged to use your creative freedom and implement the application in a way that you find best. Feel free to
add extra features, improve the UI, or use different libraries if you think it will enhance the application. The
provided requirements are the minimum expectations.

## Validation

Once you have completed the implementation, please include a separate document or section in your submission detailing
your validation process. This section should provide a comprehensive explanation of how you approached the validation of
your implemented application. Detail the steps you took to ensure its correctness, robustness, and adherence to the
challenge specifications. Include any testing strategies, tools, or techniques you employed.
